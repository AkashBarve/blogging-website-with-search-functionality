# blogging-website-with-search-functionality

A generic amateur website code that can be used for college projects.

Developed by Akash Barve and Aakash Vijay Barve.

During our third year of engineering we had developed a blogging website for our project. 

Recently I developed a simple elasticsearch interface. Project link: https://github.com/AkashBarve/Elasticsearch-with-PHP

Somehow managed to salvage parts of that old code and merge it with this search functionality.

This is not the best of websites or projects. But it would definetly help someone who is just about to start with their own project.

For implementation help with ElasticSearch part refer the above repository. 

Rest of the project can be implemented easily using Xampp and ceating a MySQL database.

Run it on the localhost after everything in the background is running perfectly!

All the best.
